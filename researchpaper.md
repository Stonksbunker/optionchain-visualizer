# Introduction 
**Openchain visualiser** is a collection of *multiple* technologies, like **python programming language**, **bash scripting**, **json** as database, **flask** as software based server , **Raspberry pi 4b** as hardware server and **arch linux** as operating system [^1].  Using web-scraping we extract data from NSE which gets saved in database (as json file) then using matplotlib in first varient and dash(component in plotty) we generate static pngs and interactive graphs.

[^1]: Here is the footnote.

## Mechanism and how it works.

## Methods of Data Scraping and how it was done.

## Different varient of the project :
classoption:
- twocolumn

### User Input
### Server based (Flask)

## Difference between both varients.
